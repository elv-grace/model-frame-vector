"""Score detector runs against box-level ground truth.

What this measures that frame presence cannot
---------------------------------------------
Frame presence asks "did the detector fire somewhere on a frame containing the class", which
saturated on this schema: brand is present in 58 frames of 100 and person in 97, so the field
landed inside a narrow F1 band. Boxes ask "did it find the object", which separates a
detector that localises from one that merely fires on the right frames.

Three numbers come out, and they answer different questions:

    AP          the ranking quality of the whole score-ordered detection list. The headline.
    P/R @ best  precision and recall at the operating point you would actually ship.
    mean IoU    tightness of the matched boxes. Not a detection metric at all -- it is a
                direct read on the crop quality the embedder inherits, since a loose box
                embeds background alongside the object and a clipped one loses the mark.

Matching
--------
Greedy by descending score, standard COCO practice: each detection takes the highest-IoU
unclaimed ground-truth box of the same class above the IoU threshold. One ground-truth box can
be matched once, so duplicate detections on the same object correctly count as false positives
-- which matters here, because the runs are ungated and Grounding DINO emits well over a
hundred detections per frame.

Ignore regions
--------------
Frames containing dense crowds cannot be exhaustively boxed, and pretending otherwise would
punish detectors for finding real people the labeller did not draw. A detection whose centre
falls inside an `ignore` region is dropped before scoring: it counts neither as a true positive
nor a false positive. Ground-truth `ignore` boxes are never counted as positives.

Cross-prompt de-duplication
---------------------------
On by default at IoU 0.6, because it is part of the pipeline rather than a scoring trick: six
near-synonymous brand terms return the same mark several times, and every repeat after the first
is both a false positive here and a wasted SigLIP forward pass in production. It lifts Grounding
DINO's brand AP from 0.166 to 0.205 and cuts the crops it emits by around a third, with the gain
coming entirely from removed duplicates rather than from found marks.

The threshold is chosen by a constraint, not by fitting AP. Class-agnostic coverage -- how many
ground-truth marks are hit by any detection -- must not fall, because if it does the suppression
is merging marks that are genuinely distinct: adjacent logos on one hoarding, or a wordmark
inside an emblem. Coverage does fall below about 0.5 (gdino 0.609 -> 0.542 at 0.3, owlv2 0.542 ->
0.484), and AP hides that because both boxes were being counted anyway. 0.6 is the smallest
value at which coverage is intact for every backend; it is also where person AP peaks. Fitting
AP instead would have chosen 0.45, which quietly destroys real marks.

Pass --nms 0 to measure the raw detector.

Class-aware and class-agnostic, and why the second one matters
--------------------------------------------------------------
Two numbers are reported per class:

    AP / P / R      class-aware. The detection must carry a tag that maps to the class. This
                    is the right measure for the default and text-target modes, where the
                    detector was told what to look for.

    coverage        CLASS-AGNOSTIC recall, and UNGATED -- see the warning below. Of the
                    ground-truth boxes of this class, how many
                    are hit at the IoU threshold by ANY detection, whatever it was labelled.

Coverage is the number that retires the tag map. A prompt-free backend answers from its own
4585-term vocabulary, so scoring it class-aware needs a mapping from "sports ball" to our
schema -- without one it scores zero by construction rather than by measurement, and that
mapping is a large hand-maintained artefact that nothing in the production pipeline consumes.
Coverage asks the question the pipeline actually cares about instead: did a crop land on the
object. What the detector called it is metadata; the embedding is the retrieval key.

Precision is deliberately not reported class-agnostically. A prompt-free run that boxes a chair
is not WRONG, it is just not boxing a target, so counting it as a false positive would measure
the schema rather than the detector.
