"""SigLIP 2 NaFlex crop embedder, loaded directly from HuggingFace transformers.

NaFlex ("native aspect ratio, flexible resolution") resizes each crop to a *patch budget*
rather than to a fixed square, preserving aspect ratio to within one patch. That matters
far more for crops than for whole frames: a 20x160 banner crop becomes 96x672 here, where a
fixed-resolution checkpoint (e.g. `-patch16-384`) would squash it 8x horizontally — and
text, signage, and wordmarks are precisely what a non-uniform squash destroys.
