"""Detection targets for the entity tagger, and the routing from a target to a detector.

The schema
----------
Two classes, measured into their current form against box-level ground truth (see eval/):

    brand   four MARK terms, and deliberately no object terms. `brand` means the mark itself --
            the GAP wordmark, not the hoodie; the NFL shield, not the helmet.

            It was six terms until `emblem` and `label` were measured for MARGINAL coverage --
            coverage of all six, minus coverage without that one term -- against box ground
            truth (eval/experiments/10_config_ab):

                prompt          gdino @0.15   gdino @0.07   yoloe @0.007
                logo               +0.042        +0.167        +0.177
                letter logo        +0.068        +0.068        +0.000
                brand              +0.062        +0.052        +0.005
                car logo           +0.005        +0.005        +0.000
                emblem             +0.000        +0.000        +0.000
                label              +0.000        +0.000        +0.016

    person  one word. `person` alone reaches 0.92-0.97 class-agnostic coverage on every
            promptable backend -- identical to a 101-term list including 18 role words
            (player, referee, commentator, fashion model). The role words bought nothing.

Mark-CARRYING surfaces (`sign`, `banner`, `billboard`) were tested and rejected: they reproduce
the overshadowing failure one level up, since a banner is a surface a logo sits on, so the box
lands on the banner. `symbol` was tested as a seventh brand term and rejected too -- it costs the
leading model AP and wins the argmax on boxes `logo` already had.

Routing
-------
The two classes want different detectors, and nothing forces one model to serve both. `person`
goes to a closed COCO detector, which beats every open-vocabulary model at the one class COCO was
built around while being the cheapest model in the study. Everything else goes to the
open-vocabulary detector.

A caller-supplied target is routed the same way, so `--params '{"detect_target": ["car"]}'` runs
only the open-vocabulary detector and `["person"]` runs only the closed one. Only `person` routes
to the closed detector today. Its COCO-80 vocabulary holds 79 other nouns and routing those there
too is a plausible optimisation, but it is unmeasured -- the comparison was never run for any
class but person -- so it is not done.
